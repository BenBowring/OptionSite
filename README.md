## About The Project

This package downloads static option chains from yahoo finance and creates the corresponding vol and delta surface.

Why:
* Yahoo finance has terrible implied vol calcs, varying from the thousands of vol points to zero
* Downloading is extremely inconsistent, there will be a decorator that runs multiple queries to get most stable api returns
* Will be used in developing a site that show live surfaces and allows for understanding of pricing mechanisms and industry practices

Barebones for now, but will be finalising with further functions, filters etc!
